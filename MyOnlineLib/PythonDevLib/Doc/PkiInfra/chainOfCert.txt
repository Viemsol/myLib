Let say On connection to server, Server send below cert chain

ServerCert->IntermidiateCA1->IntermidiateCA2-> ROOT CA

on our device any certificate if we have it will work,ie if device connecting to server have IntermidiateCA1 ,

Cert trust chin will be finished in 1st iteration and validation of chain  IntermidiateCA1->IntermidiateCA2-> ROOT CA 
will be ignored

if we have  ROOT CA installed on our device , device will validate all cft chain and it will take time.

basically ROOT CA  certificates have long expiry time , so device need not have to be updated frquenty
but cft validation is expensive in memory and time , also , attaker having cft signed by root ca , it can connect to device
